ToDoJS - An Experimental ToDo Website/Tool
-------------

I decided to create this website to test some functions in Javascript ES5. I'm also using this project to test HTML5 and CSS3. If you'd like to continue my work, I was planing on implementing local and/or session storage or, maybe, a nice noSQL database.

If you'd like to help me, you can always **fork** this repository, make your chances and submit a pull request. I'll then evaluate and commit your changes.
